# E-Waste Classification and Recycling Application

## Overview
This project aims to classify e-waste using a machine learning model and provide users with information on nearby recycling options through a mobile application.

## Classification Model
Utilizes deep learning to classify e-waste items into categories like Batteries, Circuit Boards, etc.

## Mobile Application
Allows users to upload e-waste photos for classification and receive information on nearby Recycling Centers, Dustbins, or Refurbishment Centers based on the item's state.

## Future Enhancements
- Develop a mobile application interface.
- Integrate geolocation for automated suggestions.
- Expand classification and engage with communities for feedback.
